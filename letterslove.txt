Never may God be so forgetful of his humble handmaids as to let them outlive you; \nnever may he grant us a life which would be harder to bear than any form of death.\nThe proper course would be for you to perform our funeral rites, for you to commend our souls to God, and to send ahead of you those \nwhom you assembled for God’s service — so that you need no longer be troubled by worries for us, and follow after us the more gladly \nbecause freed from concern for our salvation.\nSpare us, I implore you, master, spare us words such as these which can only intensify our existing unhappiness; do not deny us, \nbefore death, the one thing by which we live. ‘Each day has trouble enough of its own,’ and the day, shrouded in bitterness, will \nbring with it distress enough to all it comes upon. ‘Why is it necessary,’ says Seneca, ‘to summon evil’ and to destroy life before \ndeath comes?\nYou ask us, my love, if you chance to die when absent from us, to have your body brought to our burial-ground so that you may reap a \nfuller harvest from the prayers we shall offer in constant memory of you. But how could you suppose that our memory of you could ever \nfade? Besides, what time will there be then which will be fitting for prayer, when extreme distress will allow us no peace, when the \nsoul will lose its power of reason and the tongue its use of speech? Or when the frantic mind, far from being resigned, may even (if I may so) \nrage against God himself, and provoke him with complaints instead of placating him with prayers?\nIn our misery then we shall have time only for tears and no power to pray; we shall be hurrying to follow, not to bury you, so that \nwe may share your grave instead of laying you in it. If we lose our life in you, we shall not be able to go on living when you leave us.\nI would not even have us live to see that day, for if the mere mention of your death is death for us, what will the reality be if it \nfinds us still alive?

Honestly, it strikes me sometimes that I prey like a spectre on your felicitous name! \nIf only I had mailed Saturday’s letter, in which I implored you never to write to me again, and in which I gave a similar promise. \nOh God, what prevented me from sending that letter? All would be well. But is a peaceful solution possible now? Would it help if we \nwrote to each other only once a week? No, if my suffering could be cured by such means it would not be serious. And already I foresee \nthat I shan’t be able to endure even the Sunday letters. And so, to compensate for Saturday’s lost opportunity, I ask you with what \nnergy remains to me at the end of this letter: If we value our lives, let us abandon it all.\nDid I think of signing myself Dein? No, nothing could be more false. No, I am forever fettered to myself, that’s what I am, and that’s \nwhat I must try to live with.', 'If only I were a clever woman, I could describe to you my gorgeous bird, how you unite in yourself the beauties of form, plumage, and song!\nI would tell you that you are the greatest marvel of all ages, and I should only be speaking the simple truth.\xa0 But to put all this into \nsuitable words, my superb one, I should require a voice far more harmonious than that which is bestowed upon my species – for I am the \nhumble owl that you mocked at only lately, therefore, it cannot be.\nI will not tell you to what degree you are dazzling and to the birds of sweet song who, as you know, are none the less beautiful and appreciative.\nI am content to delegate to them the duty of watching, listening and admiring, while to myself I reserve the right of loving; this \nmay be less attractive to the ear, but it is sweeter far to the heart.\nI love you, I love you.\xa0 my Victor; I can not reiterate it too often; I can never express it as much as I feel it.\nI recognise you in all the beauty that surrounds me\xa0 in form, in colour, in perfume, in harmonious sound: all of these mean you to me. \nYou are superior to all.\xa0 I see and admire – you are all!\nYou are not only the solar spectrum with the seven luminous colours, but the sun himself, that illumines, warms, and revivifies!\xa0 \nThis is what you are, and I am the lowly woman that adores you.\nJuliette', 'My dear Nora,\nIt has just struck me. I came in at half past eleven. Since then I have been sitting in an easy chair like a fool. I could do nothing. \nI hear nothing but your voice. I am like a fool hearing you call me ‘Dear.’ I offended two men today by leaving them coolly. I wanted \nto hear your voice, not theirs.\nWhen I am with you I leave aside my contemptuous, suspicious nature. I wish I felt your head on my shoulder. I think I will go to bed.\nI have been a half-hour writing this thing. Will you write something to me? I hope you will. How am I to sign myself? I won’t sign \nanything at all, because I don’t know what to sign myself.', 'I already love in you your beauty, but I am only beginning to love in you that which is eternal and ever precious – your heart, \nyour soul. Beauty one could get to know and fall in love with in one hour and cease to love it as speedily; but the soul one must \nlearn to know. Believe me, nothing on earth is given without labour, even love, the most beautiful and natural of feelings.', 'Yes, Marquis, I will keep my word with you, and upon all occasions shall speak the truth, though I sometimes tell it at my own \nexpense. I have more firmness of mind than perhaps you may imagine, and ’tis very probable that in the course of this correspondence,\nyou will think I push this quality too far, even to severity. But then, please to remember that I have only the outside of a woman, \nand that my heart and mind are wholly masculine….\nShall I tell you what makes love so dangerous? ‘Tis the too high idea we are apt to form it. But to speak the truth, love, considered \nas passion, is merely a blind instinct, that we should rate accordingly. It is an appetite, which inclines us to one object, rather \nthan another, without our being able to account for our taste. Considered as a bond of friendship, where reason presides, it is no \nlonger a passion and loses the very name of love. It becomes esteem: which is indeed a very pleasing appetite, but too tranquil; and \ntherefore incapable of rousing you from you present supineness.\nIf you madly trace the footsteps of our ancient heroes of romance, adopting their extravagant sentiments, you will soon experience, \nthat such false chivalry metamorphoses this charming passion into a melancholy folly; nay, often a tragical one: a perfect frenzy! \nbut divest it of all the borrowed pomp and opinion, and you will then perceive how much it will contribute both to your happiness and \npleasure. Be assured that if either reason or knight errantry should be permitted to form the union of our hearts, love would become a \nstate of apathy and madness.\nThe only way to avoid these extremes, is to pursue the course I pointed out to you. At present you have no occasion for any thing \nmore than mere amusement, and believe me, you will not meet it except among women of the character I speak of. Your heart wants \noccupation; and they are framed to supply the void. At least, give my prescription a fair trial, and I will be answerable for the success.\nI promised to reason with you, and I think I have kept my word. \nFarewell…', 'I plowed the vast ocean on a frail bit of timber; (whereas) the ship that bore the son of AEson (Jason)* was strong… \nThe furtive arts of Cupid aided him; arts which I wish that Love had not learned from me. He returned home; I shall die in \nthese lands, if the heavy wrath of the offended God shall be lasting.\nMy burden, most faithful wife, is a harder one than that which the son of AEson bore. You, too, whom I left still young at \nmy departure from the City, I can believe to have grown old under my calamities. Oh, grant it, ye Gods, that I may be enabled \nto see you, even if such, and to give the joyous kiss on each cheek in its turn; and to embrace your emaciated body in my arms, \nand to say, “’twas anxiety, on my account, that caused this thinness”; and, weeping, to recount in person my sorrows to you in \ntears, and thus enjoy a conversation that I had never hoped for; and to offer the due frankincense, with grateful hand, to the \nCaesars, and to the wife that is worthy of a Caesar, Deities in real truth!\nOh, that the mother of Menon, that Prince being softened, would with her rosy lips, speedily call forth that day.', 'My will made by me, Laura Mary Octavia Lyttleton.\nI have not much to leave behind me, should I die next month, having my treasure deep in my heart where no one can reach it, \nand where even death cannot enter…\nI want, first of all, to tell Alfred that all I have in the world and all I am and ever shall be, belongs to him more than anyone…\nSo few women have been as happy as I have been every hour since I married – so few have had such a wonderful sky of love for their \ncommon atmosphere, that perhaps it will seem strange when I write down that the sadness of death and parting is greatly lessened to \nme by the fact of my consciousness of the eternal, indivisible oneness of Alfred and me.\nI feel as long as he is down here I must be here, silently, secretly sitting beside him as I do every evening now, however much my \nsoul is the other side, and that if Alfred were to die, we would be as we were on earth, love as we did this year, only fuller, quicker, \ndeeper than ever, with a purer passion and a wiser worship.\nOnly in the meantime, whilst my body is hid from him and my eyes cannot see him, let my trivial toys be his till the morning comes when \nnothing will matter because all is spirit.', 'My Dearest Friend,\n…should I draw you the picture of my heart it would be what I hope you would still love though it contained nothing new.\xa0 The early \npossession you obtained there, and the absolute power you have obtained over it, leaves not the smallest space unoccupied.\nI look back to the early days of our acquaintance and friendship as to the days of love and innocence, and, with an indescribable \npleasure, I have seen near a score of years roll over our heads with an affection heightened and improved by time, nor have the dreary \nyears of absence in the smallest degree effaced from my mind the image of the dear untitled man to whom I gave my heart.', 'Best Beloved,\nI send you some allumettes (lampshades) wherewith to kindle the taper. There are very few but my second finger could no longer \nperform extra duty. These will serve till the wounded one be healed, however. How beautiful is it to provide even this slightest \nconvenience for you, dearest! I cannot tell you how much I love you, in this back-handed style. My love is not in this attitude,– \nit rather bends forward to meet you.\nWhat a year has been to us! My definition of Beauty is, that it is love, and therefore includes both truth and good. But those only \nwho love as we do can feel the significance and force of this.\nMy ideas will not flow in these crooked strokes. God be with you. I am very well, and have walked far in Danvers this cold morning. \nI am full of the glory of the day. God bless you this night of the old year. It has proved the year of our nativity.

Besides, my Adele, my adorable and adored Adele, what have I not to tell you? O, God! for two days, I have \nbeen asking myself every moment if such happiness is not a dream. It seems to me that what I feel is not of earth. I cannot yet \ncomprehend this cloudless heaven.\nYou do not yet know, Adele, to what I had resigned myself. Alas, do I know it myself? Because I was weak, I fancied I was calm; \nbecause I was preparing myself for all the mad follies of despair, I thought I was courageous and resigned. Ah! let me cast myself \nhumbly at your feet, you who are so grand, so tender and strong! I had been thinking that the utmost limit of my devotion could only \nbe the sacrifice of my life; but you, my generous love, were ready to sacrifice for me the repose of yours.\n…You have been privileged to receive every gift from nature, you have both fortitude and tears. Oh, Adele, do not mistake these words \nfor blind enthusiasm – enthusiasm for you has lasted all my life, and increased day by day. My whole soul is yours. If my entire \nexistence had not been yours, the harmony of my being would have been lost, and I must have died — died inevitably.\nThese were my meditations, Adele, when the letter that was to bring me hope of else despair arrived. If you love me, you know what \nmust have been my joy. What I know you may have felt, I will not describe.\nMy Adele, why is there no word for this but joy? Is it because there is no power in human speech to express such happiness?\nThe sudden bound from mournful resignation to infinite felicity seemed to upset me. Even now I am still beside myself and sometimes \nI tremble lest I should suddenly awaken from this dream divine.\nOh, now you are mine! At last you are mine! Soon — in a few months, perhaps, my angel will sleep in my arms, will awaken in my arms, \nwill live there. All your thoughts at all moments, all your looks will be for me; all my thoughts, all my moments, all my looks, will \nbe for you! My Adele!\nAdieu, my angel, my beloved Adele! Adieu!

For the past few years you and I have shared the same pillow as man and wife who had intended to \nlive and grow old together, and I have become as attached to you as your own shadow. This is what I believed, and I think this is what \nyou have also thought about us.\nBut now I have learnt about the final enterprise on which you have decided and, though I cannot be with you to share the grand moment, \nI rejoice in the knowledge of it.

And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still \nhave lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon \nDivine Providence, but something whispers to me — perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar — that I shall return to my loved \nones unharmed.

If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the garish \nday and in the darkest night — amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours — always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your \ncheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.\nSarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.\nAs for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father’s love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember \nme long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood.

You are perhaps mindless of me.\xa0 I am not of you.\xa0 I love you.\nThere isn’t a moment of any hideous day when I do not say to myself. ‘It will be alright.\xa0 I shall go home.\xa0 Caitlin loves me.\xa0 \nI love Caitlin.’\xa0 But perhaps you have forgotten.\xa0 If you have forgotten, or lost your affection for me, please, my Cat, let me know.\xa0 \nI Love You.\nDylan', 'Have you really not noticed, then, that here of all places, in this private, personal solitude that surrounds me, I have turned to \nyou? All the memories of my youth speak to me as I walk, just as the sea shells crunch under my feet on the beach.\xa0 The crash of \nevery wave awakens far-distant reverberations within me.\nI hear the rumble of bygone days, and in my mind the whole endless series of old passions surges forward like the billows.\xa0 I remember \nmy spasms, my sorrows, gusts of desire that whistled like wind in the rigging, and vast vague longings that swirled in the dark like a \nflock of wild gulls in a storm cloud.\nOn whom should I lean, if not on you?\xa0 My weary mind turns for refreshment to the thought of you as a dusty traveler might sink onto \na soft and grassy bank.', 'Dear Anna:\nDid I say that the human might be filed in categories? Well, and if I did, let me qualify — not all humans. You elude me. I cannot \nplace you, cannot grasp you. I may boast that of nine out of ten, under given circumstances, I can forecast their action; that of \nnine out of ten, by their word or action, I may feel the pulse of their hearts. But of the tenth I despair. It is beyond me. You are \nthat tenth.\nWere ever two souls, with dumb lips, more incongruously matched! We may feel in common — surely, we oftimes do — and when we do not \nfeel in common, yet do we understand; and yet we have no common tongue. Spoken words do not come to us. We are unintelligible. God must \nlaugh at the mummery.\nThe one gleam of sanity through it all is that we are both large temperamentally, large enough to often understand. True, we often \nunderstand but in vague glimmering ways, by dim perceptions, like ghosts, which, while we doubt, haunt us with their truth. And still, \nI, for one, dare not believe; for you are that tenth which I may not forecast.\nAm I unintelligible now? I do not know. I imagine so. I cannot find the common tongue.\nLarge temperamentally — that is it. It is the one thing that brings us at all in touch. We have, flashed through us, you and I, each \na bit of universal, and so we draw together. And yet we are so different.\nI smile at you when you grow enthusiastic? It is a forgivable smile — nay, almost an envious smile. I have lived twenty-five years of \nrepression. I learned not to be enthusiastic. It is a hard lesson to forget. I begin to forget, but it is so little. At the best, \nbefore I die, I cannot hope to forget all or most. I can exult, now that I am learning, in little things, in other things; but of my \nthings, and secret things doubly mine, I cannot, I cannot. Do I make myself intelligible? Do you hear my voice? I fear not. There are \nposeurs. I am the most successful of them all.'
