Love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning.
I may not say much when I am with you, but all of me loves you all the time.
Come live in my heart and pay no rent.
Love is old, love is new, love is all, love is you.
If I had a flower for every time I thought of you … I could walk through my garden forever.
If I know what love is, it is because of you.
You know you’re in love when you can’t fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.
I would rather spend one lifetime with you, than face all the ages of this world alone
I would rather spend one lifetime with you, than face all the ages of this world alone.
To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides.
Love does not dominate; it cultivates.
The heart wants what it wants. There’s no logic to these things. You meet someone and you fall in love and that’s that.
Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.
Immature love says: ‘I love you because I need you.’ Mature love says ‘I need you because I love you.’
Loving people live in a loving world. Hostile people live in a hostile world. Same world.
Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye.
When love is not madness it is not love.
All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn’t hurt.
Love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well.
When we are in love we seem to ourselves quite different from what we were before.
Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead.
The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved; loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves.
You don’t love someone because they’re perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they’re not.
I’ve never fallen in love right off the bat. I get scared to say I love you too soon because it means so much. It means you’re not seeing an end to things.
The greatest thing you’ll ever learn is to love and be loved in return.
Love is of all passions the strongest, for it attacks simultaneously the head, the heart, and the senses.
I have decided to stick to love; hate is too great a burden to bear.
I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more.
I look at you and see the rest of my life in front of my eyes.
The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved; loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves.
All, everything that I understand, I only understand because I love.
I'm much more me when I'm with you.
It's a very dangerous state. You are inclined to recklessness and kind of tune out the rest of your life and everything that's been important to you. It's actually not all that pleasurable. I don't know who the hell wants to get in a situation where you can't bear an hour without somebody's company.
The best and most beautiful things in this world cannot be seen or even heard, but must be felt with the heart.
To love is nothing. To be loved is something. But to love and be loved, that’s everything
In order to be happy oneself it is necessary to make at least one other person happy.
Maybe the only vow we ever need to offer the one we love is this: I will never, not for a sliver of a second, make you feel alone.
There's no substitute for a great love who says, 'No matter what's wrong with you, you're welcome at this table.
Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.
If I could give you one thing in life, I would give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes, only then would you realize how special you are to me.
I can't promise to fix all your problems, but I can promise you won't have to face them all alone.
So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.
The best love is the kind that awakens the soul; that makes us reach for more, that plants the fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. That’s what I hope to give you forever.
I would rather spend one lifetime with you, than face all the ages of this world alone.
If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you.
If I know what love is, it is because of you.
You have bewitched me body and soul, and I love, I love, I love you.
Once I knew you I never wanted to know anyone else.
Love is like war: easy to begin but very hard to stop.
I never want to stop making memories with you.
However far away, I will always love you. However long I stay, I will always love you. Whatever words I say, I will always love you. I will always love you.
You and me together, through the days and nights. I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright.
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind. But you're the key to my peace of mind.
I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you.
I could watch you for a single minute and find a thousand things that I love about you.
I still haven't figured out how to sit across from you, and not be madly in love with everything you do.
I am totally completely eye-popping seriously groundbreaking passionately deliciously in love with you.
I just wanna see you. Hold you. Hug you. Touch you. Kiss you. Cuddle with you. Love you.
I love you. You annoy me more than I ever thought possible. But I want to spend every irritating minute with you.
You are my favorite notification.
We fight, we kiss, we hug, we text, we talk, we argue, we laugh, we smile, we love ... That's us.
I choose you. And I'll choose you over and over and over. Without pause, without a doubt, in a heartbeat. I'll keep choosing you.
I realized I was thinking of you, and I began to wonder how long you'd been on my mind. Then it occurred to me: Since I met you, you've never left.
I swear I couldn't love you more than I do right now, and yet I know I will tomorrow.
Thinking of you keeps me awake. Dreaming of you keeps me asleep. Being with you keeps me alive.
I wish I could turn back the clock. I'd find you sooner and love you longer.
I hope you know that every time I tell you to get home safe, stay warm, have a good day, or sleep well what I am really saying is I love you. I love you so damn much that it is starting to steal other words' meanings.
When I say I love you more, I don't mean I love you more than you love me. I mean I love you more than the bad days ahead of us, I love you more than any fight we will ever have. I love you more than the distance between us, I love you more than any obstacle that could try and come between us. I love you the most.
I want you. All of you. Your flaws. Your mistakes. Your imperfections. I want you, and only you.
If you only knew how much those little moments with you mattered to me.
How strange to dream of you even when I am wide awake.
Suddenly all the love songs were about you.
If I did anything right in my life, it was when I gave my heart to you.
I love that you are my person and I am yours, that whatever door we come to, we will open it together.
I was, and I remain, utterly and completely and totally in love with you.
When I loved you, I realized, I have never truly loved anyone. I realized, I never will truly love anyone the way I love you.
I fall more deeply in love with you, every single day.
It's not being in love that makes me happy. It is the person that I am in love with that does.
I love you and I don't want to lose you. Because my life has been better since the day I found out.
I fell in love with you because you loved me when I couldn't love myself.
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride; so I love you because I know no other way.
I love you, not only for what you are but for what I am when I am with you.
I may not get to see you as often as I like. I may not get to hold you in my arms all through the night. But deep in my heart I truly know, you're the one that I love, and can't let you go.
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach.
I love you, and I will love you until I die, and if there's a life after that, I'll love you then.
I love you, with no beginning, no end. I love you as you have become an extra necessary organ in my body. Without fear. Without expectations. Wanting nothing in return, except that you allow me to keep you here in my heart, that I may always know your strength, your eyes, and your spirit that gave me freedom and let me fly.
I've never fallen in love right off the bat. I get scared to say I love you too soon because it means so much. It means you're not seeing an end to things.
I love you. I am at rest with you. I have come home.
You are my best friend, my human diary, and my other half. You mean the world to me and I love you.
